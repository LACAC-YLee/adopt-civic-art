# adopt-civic-art

This project was inspired by City of Boston's Adopt-a-Hydrant application (an Esri Adopta app) where residents could "adopt" a fire hydrant and commit to shoveling the snow in front of the hydrant for the Fire Department to gain access after snowfalls. Instead of fire hydrants, we're adapting the model to spark civic engagement with County owned civic artworks and monitor easy-to-recognize damage like graffiti, vandalism, and guano. Adopters will be asked to submit monthly photos documenting the condition of their adopted artwork.

The demonstration project/product will be launched with ten civic artworks spread out across five supervisorial districts.

# history

This project idea was initially pitched during a monthly gathering of local civic tech/data/government people, [Data + Donuts](http://datadonuts.la).  The idea was formally pitched at Hack For LA's 2/7/17 civic hack night and quickly attracted a group of interested individuals. 

Since then, members have created a user survey and conducted user interviews.  We'll define a set of required features from the results and then we'll create a couple different app mockups for comparison. Slack channel contains detailed weekly notes and design and development artifacts. 

# specs

We chose to start with a web app.  Using a tool like PhoneGap, we'll have the possibility of compiling to mobile later on.  We will need viable short-term data storage/database solution.

# needs

We'll take anyone interested in joining, but we could really use additional members with skills in project management, graphic design, front- and back-end development.
